# cse373-MazeGenerator

This is homework project 7 for CSE373: Data Algorithms, instructed by Kasey Champion.

In this homework, Kruskal's algorithm is implemented to generate mazes and Dijkstra's algorithm is used to solve them.


Specifically, it includes four tasks:

1. implemented disjoint set using the array-based representation. This includes making the optimizations with path compression and union-by-rank.
2. implement the Graph constructor and numVertices and numEdges methods.
3. implement findMinimumSpanningTree using Kruskal's algorithm and 
4. implement findShortestPathBetween using Dijkstra's algorithm.
